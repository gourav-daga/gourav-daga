Hi, I’m Gourav Daga  
Quantitative Researcher | Machine Learning | Deep Learning | High-Dimensional Statistics  

FRM Part 1 certified | MS Statistics and Data Science

I am a quantitative researcher currently working as a Research Associate at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. My work focuses on high-dimensional covariance estimation, random matrix theory, and machine learning, with applications in quantitative finance and risk analytics.

Previously, I worked at a Sequoia-backed asset management firm where I co-managed systematic trading strategies, developed statistical arbitrage models using cointegration and time-series methods, and built machine learning systems for options pricing and volatility forecasting in live markets.

My current research explores empirical likelihood and maximum entropy approaches for robust covariance estimation and portfolio risk measurement in high-dimensional settings.
